# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push request
# events but only for the main branch

# Does not work.
# Could not get past issue with version always being "main"
# I was trying to get the semver to automatically save the different tags for the version
# Spent too long trying to get this to work. Just leaving it here to show work done.
# If you know what I am missing please educate me. Thanks in advance.
