# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push request
# events but only for the main branch

# Does not work.
# Could not get past issue with version always being "main"
# I was trying to get the semver to automatically save the different tags for the version
# According to an article I found on the internet. Having forked a project it will
# always get the information from the forked project and not this project.
# Spent too long trying to get this to work. Just leaving it here to show work done.
